How to use?
(pls read allat its better for your enjoyement of my product)

For the ExaRun and pine tree, go to 'https://exa23.itch.io/jitbit-login-pine-macro' .
And also read allat yk its better. Make sure to put ur sprinklers in the slot 1 of the bss hotbar.
If u dont have a sprinkler yet, just dont put one

The program is still a prototype, which means it has some bugs, and some commands still aren't scripted.
Commands that dont work:
-Hive to field
-Field to hive
-Walk Pattern (means like walk in a square and then put hold click to farm, kinda complicated, templates are better to use imo.)

 and yea thats it. Also btw if you didnt install my program from the link 'https://exa23.itch.io/swarmacro' then its prob a virus or a     redistribution.
